Room : Public Key Cryptography Basic
Date Completed : Jan 21, 2026
Category : Cryptography

Objective:
Understand the fundamentals of asymmetric cryptosystems and their applications, including RSA, Diffie‑Hellman, SSH, SSL/TLS certificates, and PGP/GPG. Demonstrate how these concepts secure communication and how SOC analysts encounter them in practice.

📝Task 3: RSA

Key Takeaways
	• RSA: Asymmetric encryption method used to secure data transmission
	• Security relies on the difficulty of factoring large number
	
Security Perspective:
	• Weak key sizes (<2048 bits) are vulnerable to brute force.

📝Task 4: Diffie-Hellman

Key Takeaways
	• Diffie-Hellman: key exchange protocol over an insecure communication channel
	• Security relies  on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem in modular arithmetic

Security Perspective:
Strong parameters are essential; weak ones can be exploited

📝Task 5: SSH

Key Takeaways
	• SSH clients verify server public key fingerprints to prevent MITM attacks
	• - Authentication uses public/private key pairs (commonly RSA).
	• Tools: `ssh-keygen` generates key pairs
		○ Commands: ssh-keygen -t <key_type>

Security Perspective:
	• As a user, we must make sure to recognise our server public key as this may lead to MITM attack

📝Task 6: Digital Signature and Certificates

Key Takeaways
	• Digital signature: verify the authenticity and integrity of a digital message
	• Certificates: rely on a chain of trust to validate source

Security perspective:
Chain of trust prevents spoofed or malicious certificates

📝Task 7: PGP and GPG

Key Takeaways
	• PGP : software that implements encryption for files
	• GPG: widely used in email to protect confidentiality of the email message
	• Tools: gpg to sign only or sign and encrypting
		○ Commands: gpg --full-generate-key

Security Perspective:
Protects against email tampering and ensures confidentiality

Summary

This room reinforced the importance of asymmetric cryptography in securing communications. For a SOC analyst, recognizing weak implementations (e.g., small RSA keys, untrusted certificates, or fingerprint mismatches) is critical for detecting vulnerabilities and preventing attacks
